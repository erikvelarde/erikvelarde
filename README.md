# Hey, I'm Freddy Velarde! 👋

I'm a passionate programmer who loves taking on new challenges and constantly learning. I have been coding for the past 3 years, working on a variety of personal projects ranging from React.js front-end projects to Rust CLI apps.

## Where did I learn about software development?

I learned everything about software development through self-study using online resources, primarily relying on the internet to expand my knowledge and skills in programming languages, tools, and frameworks.

## So, what about university (college)?

I'm currently attending university (UMSA), but to be honest my main focus is on my coding projects. Although I find that university has helped me connect with like-minded individuals who share my passion for programming and software development.
