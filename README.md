## Hey what's up! 👋

I do love programming, get different challenges and at the same time, learn through it.

I've been coding for the last 3 years on different personal projects, from React.js front-end projects to Rust CLI apps.

Where did I learn everything about software development?

My knowledge in software development comes from my trusty teacher - the internet. It's been my go-to source for all things tech-related. But, I'm not just a theory guy - I've also completed several projects that demonstrate my practical skills in programming and software development.
