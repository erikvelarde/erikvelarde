# Hey, I'm Freddy Velarde! ðŸ‘‹

<!--  I'm a passionate programmer who loves taking on new challenges and constantly learning. I have been coding for the past 3 years, working on a variety of personal projects ranging from React.js front-end projects to Rust CLI apps. I'm also a big fan of Linux and love exploring its different distributions and features.

## Where did I learn about software development?

I learned everything about software development through self-study using online resources, primarily relying on the internet to expand my knowledge and skills in programming languages, tools, and frameworks. 
### Education?

Currently, I am pursuing a degree in computer science at UMSA (University of My Studies and Ambitions). My goal is to graduate in 2026 and continue honing my skills in software development while applying my knowledge to real-world challenges.
