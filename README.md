## Hey what's up! 👋
Hello, my name is Freddy Erick Velarde S. and I am a software developer with a passion for open-source projects and Linux.

I am a strong believer in the power of open-source software to drive innovation and collaboration in the tech community. I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and have experience in some programming languages, such as javascript and python

I am also a big fan of Linux and have experience working with ArchLinux distribution,  I appreciate the flexibility and customization options that Linux offers and enjoy experimenting with different configurations and tools.

On my Github profile, you can find a variety of open-source projects that I have worked on, including "pycopy". I am always looking for new opportunities to contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with other developers.

Thank you for visiting my Github profile. I look forward to connecting with other like-minded individuals in the open-source and Linux community.
